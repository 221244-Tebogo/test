# Interactive Development 200 Term 1 Component Based Development -  Tebogo Ramolobeng

## About the project:

I embarked on a journey to delve into the world of Component-Based Development. The primary focus of this term was on the further development of advanced JavaScript concepts, particularly related to JavaScript's two major data structures: Arrays and Objects. Additionally, I explored data-driven development and data visualization. This document outlines my learning experience and how I implemented my project based on the instructions provided.<br></br>

This project is centered around the development of a data-driven web application that focuses on data visualization using frameworks such as Charts.js. It's an opportunity to further your understanding of Component-Based Development while creating interactive and informative charts. The project's core elements include utilizing JavaScript, Axios for API integration, and a frontend framework like React.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### How to install:

* React Bootstrap <br> `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
* React Router DOM <br> `npm i react-router-dom`
* Axios <br> `npm i axios`


### Install Dependencies: 
* npm i @iconscout/react-unicons
* npm i @mui/material
* npm i chart.js
* npm i framer-motion
* npm i react-dropdown
* npm i @babel/core

## Features and Functionality:

The web application is structured around six primary user-facing pages. The initial page serves as the home screen, showcasing the top questions that students have asked as well as a search bar where a user can search for a question and an answer. Next, on the questions page, the user will be able to "ask" a question about their code. They'll be able to type the question as well as select tags that are related to their question. Additionally the user will also be able to add extra information to help better describe their question. If the user then wants to they can add an image of their code before they upload the question. 

Moving on to the answers page, this is where users will be able to see questions that have already been answered as well as questions that are yet to be answered. They might also want to view more information around a specific question and move on to the answered questions page. However at the very beginning of the journey the user should first log in or sign up so that when they are logged in then they can see their profile on the profile page.

## Concept Process:

### Ideation:

In the initial brainstorming stage of the project, we took a look at Stack Overflow that was our main inspiration for this project and took the parts from that website that we liked and started forming wireframes around that. Next we looked through what we do not like about the website and we tried to rework those things to fit what we think would be a better output option. After we set up the wireframes we started with the initial setup of the codebase as well as the server side setup.

## Project Overview

The main theme of this term's project was the research, analysis, implementation, and visualization of a data set (API) of my choice. It was essential to select a sufficiently complex data set for my application. To visualize the data set, I utilized Charts.js, an open-source data visualization framework. I also implemented my unique form of data visualization, which was thematically related to the chosen data set. Additionally, I explored the concept of component-based development by using the React framework to construct the front end.


## Project Specifications
1. Landing Page
My landing page consisted of a dashboard-style interface, showcasing a summary or breakdown of the chosen dataset. I included contextual information outlining key factors of my research and the selected data set.

#### 1.1 Unique UI Visualization
On the landing page, I included a UI element of my design that thematically matched and outlined a specific aspect of my dataset.

#### 2. Comparison Page
My application included a dedicated page for the comparison of two objects in the data set. I utilized a Bar graph, Pie chart, and a Polar Area or Radar chart to outline the comparative properties of the two objects.

#### 3. Timeline Page
The timeline page included a Line graph representing at least 5 different object properties, represented across the span of the data set. This graph was updated based on the user's selected property.

## Implementation
In my project, I chose [mention the name of the API or data set you selected] as my data source. I researched this data set extensively to understand its structure and content. I then implemented the following components based on the project requirements:

### Landing Page
I created a landing page that displayed a dashboard-style interface. It provided a summary of the chosen data set, including key statistics and trends. I also implemented a unique UI visualization element that highlighted a specific aspect of the data set, providing users with a quick and engaging overview.

### Comparison Page
For the comparison page, I designed a dedicated section where users could compare two objects from the data set. I used Bar graphs, Pie charts, and a Polar Area or Radar chart to present the comparative properties of the selected objects. This allowed users to gain valuable insights into the data.

### Challenges

One of the most significant challenges I faced during this project was grasping the process of pulling data from an external API and effectively integrating it into my application. Additionally, I encountered difficulties in rendering and presenting the retrieved data in a user-friendly format.


## Future Implementation

To enhance my skills and become more industry-ready, I plan to focus on gaining a deeper understanding of React and JavaScript. This will enable me to tackle similar projects with more confidence and efficiency.

## Conclusion
This term's project was a significant learning experience. I successfully implemented a data-driven web application using Component-Based Development with React and data visualization with Charts.js. I honed my skills in JavaScript, data processing, and web development, and I now have a deeper understanding of data-driven applications. This project has prepared me for more advanced web development challenges in the future, and I look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I've gained in my upcoming projects.
